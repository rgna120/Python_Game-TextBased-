# Python_Game-TextBased

This is a simple text-based adventure game where the player explores a series of dungeons to find the exit. Each dungeon is represented as a grid of characters, with walls represented by "#" and open paths represented by ".". The player starts at position "S" and must navigate through the dungeon to find the exit "E", while avoiding walls and other obstacles.

The game features multiple levels, each with its own unique dungeon layout. After finding the exit in one level, the player proceeds to the next level until all levels are completed. The game provides a basic command-line interface where the player can input directions (up, down, left, right) to move through the dungeon.

This project serves as a simple example of text-based game development in Python and can be extended with additional features such as enemies, items, traps, or more complex level designs. It is suitable for beginners looking to learn Python programming or game development concepts.
